# Nootropics v. Stimulants

#### Amphetamines, Methylphenidate, Modafinil, Caffeine, NIcotine. 

They act as direct agonists or indirect agonists of dopamine receptor D<sub>1</sub>, \alpha-2 adrenoceptor, or both receptors in the PFC. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that these improve performance on working memory, episodic memory, inhibitory control, and task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and performance on tedious tasks that require a high degree of effort.

#### Racetams

They work by activating glutamate receptors that are co-localized with cholinergic receptors, thus increasing the frequency of the latter. 

- Noopept : IN addition to above, it modulates GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and disturbances of inhbitory processes are characteristic of diverse cerebral pathologies. Potentiation of this receptor also explains its anxiolytic effect, in addition to its up-regulation of BDNF release. BDNF is brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Noopept has also been found to increase the entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the neurons of CA1 radial layer in cultured rat hippocampal slices. However, it did not do this in the neurons of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer. This is in line with its ability to enhance stimulation of neural activity while also being neuroprotective.
- Fasoracetam: This is a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activator


#### Cholinergics

- Choline is the precursor to Acetyl Choline, which is a neurotransmitter that (in our CNS) plays an important role in alertness, sustaining attention, learning, and memory. Given its large polar ammonium group, it does not pass the blood-brain barrier. Neither does Choline. Only Alpha-GPC rapidly passes the BBB enabling acetylcholine synthesis in the brain. 
- Huperzine A is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which means it enables more ACh to remain in the synaptic cleft

#### Catecholamine Pre-Cursors

- L-Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. 

#### Neurosteroids

- Pregnenolone is found to enhance learning and memory, relieve depression, have a neuroprotective role in various neuroinflammatory diseases. It also interacts with MAP-2, which enhances microtubule polymerization and facilitates neural growth and plasticity. Interestingly enough, MAP2 is a novel biomarker for bipolar depression. 

#### Ayurveda

- Bacopa monnieri has been found to increase serum calcium levels, and significant improvement in two neurospsychological measures: The Backward Digit Span which is a test of working memory, as well as the Logical Memory Test which is a test of immediate recall of logical material and language comprehension. 300mg qd for 6 wks. 

#### 

- ALCAR stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis in old rodents. This has low permeability across the BBB but a small amount can cause an increase in hippocampal AMPK activation. AMPK Activation suppresses HMG-CoA reducatase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, thereby restoring ATP levels by reducing FA and cholesterol synthesis. 

#### Exercise

- consistent with our findings, their results indicated that the high-intensity (145 bpm; ~80% HRmax) cycling group demonstrated a significantly greater BDNF response compared with the low-intensity (99 bpm; <57% HRmax) and control groups, immediately after exercise. Interestingly, their low-intensity group did not demonstrate a significant change in BDNF compared with the nonexercise control group. 
- In the present meta-analysis, we studied the impact of acute exercise and exercise intervention on peripheral blood BDNF concentrations in older adults (agedâ‰¥60 years) free
from major chronic diseases. Strength training provoked a signifcant increase in peripheral blood BDNF concentrations in older adults, while aerobic exercise training did not exert such an efect. However, when strength training was added to aerobic exercise training, peripheral blood BDNF concentrations increased as well.
