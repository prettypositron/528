Update: fuck this, every paper contradicts another. 


# Neuroimaging
### Structural

Enlargements:
- Total Lateral Ventricles
- Caudate
- Putamen
- Global pallidus

Volumetric Reductions:
- Thalamus
- Hippocampus
- Corpus Callosum, cross-sectional area

Let's go over these structural areas one by one. 

The lateral ventricles are the two largest cavities int he brain and contain cerebrospinal fluid. This is involved in various things most notably as a filtration system that facilitates the removal of metabolic waste from the brain and exchange of biomolecules and xenobiotics into and out of the brain. 

The caudate nucleus and the putamen combine to form the dorsal striatum.

The neocortex innervates the dorsal striatum which is full of glutamatergic neurons. Glutamate is an excitatory neuron. 

The global pallidus

The putamen plays a role in reinforcement learning (interacting with the environment and catering actions to maximize the outcome), implicit learning (acquiring knowledge through passiver exposure)



The hippocampus is responsible for short-term memory, long-term memory, and spatial memory. I don't believe I suffer from deficits in these categories. Upon further inspection, I found that my [left hippocampus is enlarged.](https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/psych/5271/yma80001f3.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=tEfkpIoSS9WH6s9KeyVeq2notVLxtSweOv0ZAnG5WAUXkERDBFI0dSpNIeXYWv8GYT2kAmx5-Qmw~AQWuCLBCS3HHKYyYXqwfhmkuCmTrfr3SafYcZYK~G2u~SLBGOTMiMPx7LfrBIjJDLzK1PaTBqgkLXaMy~D6IfWrcGifQC8u~SFk2m6VS-V01RwVCrXtag8lNae7crhszIxpymIX9o58cbWrJr5iJcektvWyBb8gbUK5RrPcfUjaMzPBW75WreoAq-PzPWZKiitmxoFH4gGxvmVlBPUG-E7PoDfKOwipfLFoV-WE2WOGC065FnQnpDeDpAFOJ7Xp2~9Dp35G4A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA) 

My PFC (pre-frontal cortex) is smaller than average. This means I have a deficit in response inhibition. I also have volumetric reductions in my hippocampus


However, my Striatum and globus pallidus are enlarged.
